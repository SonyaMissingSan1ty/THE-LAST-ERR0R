# The Last Error

**The Last Error** is a short text-based psychological horror game written in Python.  
You're told it's a logic test. It isn't.  
Meet Vern.

## How to Play

- Run the game using Python 3.
- Music will play if `pygame` is installed and the `musicita` file is present.
- All responses should be **one word**, using only **letters** (no punctuation or numbers).
- The game is slow-burn and has multiple endings based on your answers and personality traits.
- It uses your choices to shift the experience. Replay for different outcomes.

## Reset System

- Typing `restart` after finishing an ending **only resets Vernâ€™s memory** (soft reset).
- Typing `reset` performs a **complete reset**, erasing all progress and memory.
- Be careful which one you choose.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pygame`
  - Install with: `pip install pygame`

## Music

- File: `musicita`
- Ensure it's in the correct folder.
- Music plays automatically to enhance the atmosphere.
